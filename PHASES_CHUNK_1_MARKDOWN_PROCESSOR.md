# Chunk 1 Phase Breakdown: Markdown Processing Library

## Phasing Strategy Overview

The `@slashmd/md-mapper` library is broken into 4 focused phases to ensure each sub-agent can complete their work within context limits while maintaining logical dependencies. Each phase builds upon the previous one with clear handoff points.

**Key Principles:**
- Foundation-first approach (basic infrastructure before advanced features)
- Clear API contracts maintained throughout
- Incremental complexity (simple block types â†’ complex â†’ custom syntax â†’ optimization)
- Self-contained deliverables per phase

   - `tsconfig.json` configuration
   - Basic build setup

2. **Core Type System**
   - `src/index.ts` with complete TypeScript interfaces

3. **Basic Remark Pipeline**
   - `src/parser.ts` foundation with remark processor setup
   - `src/serializer.ts` foundation with stringify capabilities
   - Source range tracking utilities in `src/ranges.ts`

4. **Simple Block Types Implementation**
   - Paragraph blocks (plain text)
   - Heading blocks (h1-h3 with level + content)
   - Divider blocks (horizontal rules)
   - Basic content extraction and serialization

5. **Initial Testing Framework**

   - Callout type detection and content extraction
   - Integration with existing blockquote parsing

2. **Toggle/Details Support**
   - Parse `<details><summary>` HTML blocks
   - Toggle block type with summary + content
   - Collapsible content preservation

3. **Stable ID Generation**
   - `src/ids.ts` implementation
   - Hash-based ID generation for consistent block identification
   - ID stability across document edits
   - Collision handling for similar content

4. **Incremental Updates**

## Cross-Phase Guidelines

### Context Minimization
- Each phase should document its changes in a brief handoff summary
- Avoid deep code diving in handoffs - focus on interface contracts
- Test files serve as documentation of expected behavior
- README updates track feature completion status

### Quality Gates
- Each phase must pass existing tests before adding new features
- No phase should break previously working functionality
- Source range accuracy must be maintained throughout
- Round-trip fidelity is non-negotiable

### Risk Mitigation
- Phase 1 validates the overall technical approach early
- Phase 2 proves scalability with complex standard features
- Phase 3 addresses custom requirements before optimization
- Phase 4 ensures production readiness and integration success
